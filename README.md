Burrow
==========

Burrow is an attempt to rapidly build a "Flappy-Bird" like game in a short period of time.  I gave myself one weekend when I had little homework to build a complete game.  I took the base libraries that I developed for [Arcis](https://github.com/Tornquist/Arcis) and completely rewrote them.  With that system in place I was quickly able to product a full game that was both visually appealing and had a balanced and enjoyable feel to it. 

###Goals

1. Scaling Viewport (with letterboxing)
      * Arcis used a view that simply stretched to meet the screen size.  I wanted to create something that would letter box and display better.
2. Updated Input System --> Redesigned Touch Event Methods
3. Improved Button Objects
4. Rapid Development (1 day)
5. Fun.  -->  I wanted to design something with a much smaller learning curve.  Arcis' curve is huge.  

###Testing

Unlike Arcis, this was a much much smaller project.  I tested locally and on the phones of two or three friends before deploying.  I was immediately notified via Google Play of another error and was able to quickly correct it
